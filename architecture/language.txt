This new language design will borrow heavily from haxe's 'everything is an expression' theme.

As it was said on the tin, everything is an expression and can consequently be used in assignments, parameters
and everything else.

The only restriction is that some expressions will not return a value (void), because that would not make much sese.
(What does a variable declaration return)

The Language contains closures. They are used to determine which Expression should be viewed as tainted from where.

The exact syntax can be taken from the Parser.y, but it should feel very similar to anyone familiar with haxe.
