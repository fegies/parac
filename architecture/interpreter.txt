The Compiler will create bytecode that contains explicit fork - join instructions.
This bytecode is supposed to be executed in an interpreter that can create a lightweight context for
each of these threadlets of execution, and map the threadlets on operating system threads.

Synchronisation is done via those instructions in the bytecode and should ideally be something the programmer does not
have to worry about.

The programmer does have the option of expcicitly specifying wether an expression should be considered pure or impure
by use of the pure and tained keywords. Tainted Expressions are never parallelised while pure expressions can be parallelised
if they meet certain further criterias, like expected weight, or the number of pure expressions in a context exceed a certain
number.
