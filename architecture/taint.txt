Every expression has an associated taint level after taint checks.
This level is either infinite, or it can be described using an integer.

it can only become infinite if it is explicity tagged tainted by the programmer.

An expression is consideret pure and therefore parallelizable if it has a taint level of 0.

The taint level of any exrpession with a integral taint level describes the n'th parent context the expression modifies.

Therefore the taint level of an expression can be calculated as the maximum of the write access to parent levels of itself
and the taint levels of all subexpressions (in the case of blocks or arithmetic or anything of the likes)
